In this article, we will show you two methods to change the language in Tomb Raider 2013 from Russian to English: one using the game's settings menu and another using the game's data files.
 
## Method 1: Using the Game's Settings Menu
 
This method is the easiest and most recommended way to change the language in Tomb Raider 2013 from Russian to English. However, it may not work for some repacks or versions of the game that have the language files removed or modified. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Launch the game and wait for it to load.
2. On the main menu, click on the gear icon on the bottom right corner to open the settings menu.
3. On the settings menu, click on the second tab from the left, which has a globe icon. This is the language tab.
4. On the language tab, you will see two options: one for subtitles and one for voice-overs. Click on each option and select English from the drop-down menu.
5. Click on Apply on the bottom right corner to save your changes.
6. Restart the game and enjoy it in English.

## Method 2: Using the Game's Data Files
 
This method is more complicated and may require some technical skills. It involves editing some files in the game's installation folder. This method may work for some repacks or versions of the game that have the language files intact but not accessible from the settings menu. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Locate your game's installation folder. It may vary depending on where you downloaded or installed the game. For example, it may be C:\Program Files (x86)\Tomb Raider 2013 or D:\Games\Tomb Raider 2013.
2. In your game's installation folder, open the folder named "data".
3. In the data folder, open the file named "boot.cfg" with a text editor such as Notepad or Notepad++.
4. In the boot.cfg file, look for a line that starts with "language =". It may look something like this: language = russian
5. Change the word after "language =" to english. For example: language = english
6. Save and close the boot.cfg file.
7. In your game's installation folder, open another folder named "bigfile".
8. In the bigfile folder, you will see several files with names like "bigfile\_english.dat", "bigfile\_russian.dat", etc. These are the language files for different regions.
9. Rename or delete any file that has "russian" in its name. For example: bigfile\_russian.dat
10. Rename any file that has "english" in its name to "bigfile.dat". For example: bigfile\_english.dat -> bigfile.dat
11. Restart your game and enjoy it in English.
